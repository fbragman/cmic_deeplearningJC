# CMIC deep learning journal club

The aim of this journal club is to discuss any subject related to deep learning and machine learning. This is an informal event with the aim of promoting discussions about the state of the art and other topics. 

There will be two speakers per session. Material to be presented can be based on an upcoming paper, an interesting blog-post, a new code library and so forth.

* Meetings are on the 3rd Monday of every month from 2-3pm.
